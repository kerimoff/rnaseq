### Introduction

**nfcore/rnaseq** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for RNA sequencing data.

The workflow processes raw data from FastQ inputs ([FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), [Trim Galore!](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)), aligns the reads ([STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) or [HiSAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml)), generates gene counts ([featureCounts](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/), [StringTie](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/)) and performs extensive quality-control on the results ([RSeQC](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/), [dupRadar](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dupRadar.html), [Preseq](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/preseq/), [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html), [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info/)). See the [output documentation](docs/output.md) for more details of the results.

Additionally, the pipeline is expanded to be able to quantify transcript, exon, alternative splicing and TxRevise expressions. See [optional quantification methods](docs/extra_phenotype_quantification.md) for details.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a bioinformatics workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker / singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.
